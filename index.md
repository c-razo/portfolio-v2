### **About Me**

Hi there! My name is **Chris Razo**, and I’m a passionate IT and cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in fitness, a keen eye for technology, and a drive to continuously learn and adapt.

#### **Professional Narrative**
For over a decade, I worked in the fitness industry, guiding individuals toward healthier lives. This experience instilled in me a deep appreciation for discipline, attention to detail, and the importance of creating structured plans to achieve goals—skills I now apply to the world of IT and cybersecurity.

My journey into cybersecurity began with a curiosity for understanding how systems work—and how to protect them. Earning certifications like **CompTIA Security+**, **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity**, and the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** gave me a solid theoretical base. Since then, I’ve focused on building hands-on experience through projects and labs that tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges, from password cracking and network analysis to creating user-friendly security tools.

#### **What Motivates Me**
I’m driven by the desire to help businesses and individuals secure their systems against ever-evolving cyber threats. Knowing that I can play a role in protecting sensitive information and reducing vulnerabilities fuels my commitment to this field. My previous experiences in helping others achieve their personal goals translate into my current mission: empowering others to understand and implement strong cybersecurity practices.

#### **Career Aspirations**
I aim to contribute to organizations by:
- Enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
- Identifying vulnerabilities and implementing practical, scalable solutions.
- Developing innovative tools that bridge the gap between technical complexity and user-friendliness.

In the long term, I aspire to specialize in penetration testing, threat analysis, and advanced cybersecurity tool development, ensuring businesses stay one step ahead of attackers.

#### **Key Skills**

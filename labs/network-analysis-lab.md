# Network Analysis Lab: Exploring and Securing Network Traffic

**By Christopher Razo**

---

## Overview

The **Network Analysis Lab** provides an in-depth exploration of network traffic monitoring and analysis using tools like Wireshark. It focuses on identifying potential security vulnerabilities, analyzing malicious activity, and improving network defenses.

This lab equips learners with practical skills to monitor and secure network environments effectively.

## Features

- **Traffic Capture**: Demonstrates how to capture network packets using Wireshark.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Explores protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and more.
- **Threat Detection**: Teaches how to identify suspicious or malicious activity in network traffic.
- **Hands-On Scenarios**: Includes real-world examples for practical learning.

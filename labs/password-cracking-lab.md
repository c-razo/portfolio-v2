# Password Cracking Lab: Enhancing Security Through Ethical Hacking

**By Chris Razo**

---

## Overview

The **Password Cracking Lab** explores ethical hacking techniques to analyze and strengthen password security. Using tools such as Hashcat and John the Ripper, this lab focuses on understanding password vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures.

This project aims to educate learners on how attackers exploit weak passwords and how to mitigate these risks.
